=========================

Using KDE SC 4.8 (and later), setting up ownCloud is very easy.

To synchronize with KDE SC:

1. From System Settings Personal Information/Akonadi Resources Configuration 
   select DAV Groupware resource.

2. Enter your ownCloud username and password and click "Next".

You can find the Contacts and Calendars in Kontact (or KOrganizer/KAddressbook 
if you run the programs separately.)
